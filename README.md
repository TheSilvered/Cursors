# Cursors

Custom cursors I made.

## Using

Currently only Windows is supported. Generating the cursors requires Inkscape, python3 and the python library `pillow`.

To generate the cursors run:

```sh
python generate.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If some cursors don't generate correctly try running the script again. There is a bug in Inkscape that makes it crash if it is run too many times concurrently.

To install them run `install.inf` inside the newly generated `cursors` folder.
